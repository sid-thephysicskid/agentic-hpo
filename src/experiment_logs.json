            "creator_reasoning": "The suggested hyperparameters are moderate values within the provided search space. A moderate learning rate of 0.05 is chosen as it is neither too slow nor too fast, helping the model converge at a moderate speed. The max_depth is set to 4 to start with a balance between model complexity and learning capability. The n_estimators are set to 150 to limit the number of boosting stages and avoid overfitting. The subsample is set to 0.8 to allow each tree to train on 80% of the data, which should help prevent overfitting while still providing a diverse set of examples."
